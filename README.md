# heart-disease-risk-prediction
Supervised Machine Learning algorithms are applied namely Decision Tree, Support Vector Machine, KNN

Details explanation of concepts used in this repository can be found in [medium](https://naveen-varma.medium.com/heart-disease-risk-prediction-using-supervised-machine-learning-baaece3649a)

> Python and Jupyter Notebook are used to implement this project
## Running the code:
- Install anaconda (it comes with jupyter)
- Install the code files and dataset in your system
- run the jupyter notebook
- open the preprocessing_data file and run it
- Then run training_model file
- then run model_selection file
- Final selected model can be tested in heart_disease_prediction file
